# This file contains different issues that can be fixed in this repo

Each issue is in a h2 block.
Use subagents to solve the issues one by one. If one subagent gets stuck, stop it and start another one.
Do not stop. If an issue is too hard, skip it and try it later.
If an issue is fixed, mark it with the text fixed.
First, read the AGENTS.md, and then start fixing issues.
